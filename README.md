# About the Lilacs Methodology

The LILACS Methodology is a component of the Virtual Health Library and is in continuous development. It is composed of standards, manuals, guides and applications for the collection, selection, description and indexing of documents and also for database generation.

The methodology emerged in 1982 from the need of a common methodology for the scientific-technical literature produced in the Latin America and the Caribbean area.
By using the methodology, all countries that integrate the Latin American and Caribbean System on Health Information Sciences are able to create local and national databases as well as to cooperate with records for LILACS database, this way contributing with bibliographic control and the spread of scientific-technic literature in the Region, as established by the Virtual Health Library model of technical cooperation.
The set of databases that use the patterns and rules established by the LILACS Methodology is entitled as LILACS System. The system is currently integrated by the following databases: LILACS, BBO, BDENF, MEDCARIB and national databases from Latin America and the Caribbean.
